OpenStack-Ansible Overview
=========================

The OpenStack-Ansible project 
OpenStack-Ansible's mission statement is:

::

    OpenStack-Ansible provides production-ready deployment tools for
    operating OpenStack clouds.

OpenStack-Ansible provides `Centos7.2 <http://mirror.centos.org/>`__ os and
`SaltStack <http://www.saltstack.com/>`__ sls to meet OpenStack-Ansible's mission.
OpenStack-Ansible is highly opinionated out of the box, but allows for complete
customization. This permits operators with little experience to deploy
OpenStack quickly and as experience grows modify the OpenStack
configuration to suit the operator's exact requirements.
